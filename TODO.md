## Summary
The Tableview now displays tables grouped by department, showing all tables from the selected outlets under their respective department headings. Users can now filter tables by selecting a specific department from the dropdown, allowing focused views like showing only "Family Dining" tables. This allows users to see tables organized by department rather than by outlet.
