# Implementation Plan for Pickup/Delivery Modal in Orders.tsx

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Step 1: Add new state variables for the modal (showPickupDeliveryModal: boolean, currentOrderType: 'pickup' | 'delivery' | null).
- [x] Step 2: Modify handleTabClick function to open the modal specifically for 'Pickup' and 'Delivery' tabs, setting currentOrderType and ensuring showOrderDetails is true for item addition.
- [x] Step 3: Update the customer name input to be editable (remove readOnly) so it can be used in the modal.
- [x] Step 4: Add the JSX for the Pickup/Delivery Modal, including Form.Group for editable Name and Mobile fields (reuse existing logic), a Table for items (columns: Item Name, Quantity, Amount), totals row (Total Qty and Total Amount), and a red "Make Payment" button.
- [x] Step 5: Implement handleMakePayment function: clear customerName and mobileNumber, set showPickupDeliveryModal to false, reset items to [], optionally refresh tables.
- [x] Step 6: Ensure the modal integrates with existing item states and OrderDetails for adding items while modal is open.
- [ ] Step 7: Test the implementation by running the dev server and verifying functionality.

After all steps, mark as complete and use attempt_completion.
