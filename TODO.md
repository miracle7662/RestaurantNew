# TODO: Implement Extra Items Functionality in Orders Component

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Update UI to visually distinguish extra items in the item list (e.g., italic text, different background)
- [ ] Update KOT printing to include extra items marked as non-billed
- [ ] Update bill printing to handle extra items appropriately (exclude from bill items list since non-billed)
- [ ] Update quantity increase/decrease handlers to disable for extra items (qty fixed at 1)
- [ ] Verify API calls (createBill) include extra items with appropriate flags
- [ ] Enhance UI elements for adding extra items (improve modal or add button)
- [ ] Test adding/removing extra items, verify calculations, printing, and backend handling
