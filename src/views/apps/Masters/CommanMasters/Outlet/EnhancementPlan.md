# Enhancement Plan for AddOutlet Component

## Enhancements to AddOutlet.tsx

1. **Add Validation for Form Fields**
   - Implement validation logic to check that all required fields are filled out before submission.
   - Use a state variable to track validation errors and display error messages accordingly.

2. **Implement Success Message or Toast Notification**
   - After successfully adding an outlet, display a success message or toast notification to inform the user.
   - Utilize a notification library (react-toastify) for displaying messages.

3. **Review Integration Options**
   - Compare the integration options in `AddOutlet.tsx` with those in `ModifyoutletSettings.tsx`.
   - Ensure that any shared logic or settings are consistent across both components.

4. **Code Structure Improvements**
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for better type safety.
   - Improve error handling for API calls.
   - Add loading states to enhance user experience.

## Testing
- Test the `AddOutlet` component to ensure that the new features work as expected.
- Verify that the integration options are consistent with `ModifyoutletSettings.tsx`.

## Follow-Up Steps

- Conduct testing to ensure all features function correctly.
